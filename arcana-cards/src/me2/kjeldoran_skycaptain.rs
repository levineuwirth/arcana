//! Kjeldoran Skycaptain — `{4}{W}` 2/2 Human Soldier with Flying, First Strike,
//! and Banding.
//! Ice Age uncommon (1995); combines aerial evasion with first-strike
//! damage priority and banding's combat-damage-assignment control.
//!
//! # Rules references
//!
//! * CR 702.9 — Flying. Can only be blocked by creatures with Flying
//!   or Reach. Engine wiring lives in [`arcana_core::combat`]'s
//!   blocker filter.
//! * CR 702.7 — First Strike. Deals combat damage in the first combat
//!   damage step; opposing creatures without first/double strike deal
//!   damage in the second step.
//! * CR 702.21 — Banding. Any creatures with banding, and up to one
//!   without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If
//!   any creatures with banding you control are blocking or being
//!   blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage,
//!   not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked
//!   by or is blocking.
//!
//! All three keywords are base characteristics on this card; listing
//! them in `keywords` is sufficient — the runtime pipeline handles
//! the rest.

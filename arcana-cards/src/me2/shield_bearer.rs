//! Shield Bearer — `{1}{W}` 0/3 Human Soldier with Banding.
//! Portal Second Age common (1998); a defensive banding creature
//! whose high toughness relative to power reflects a shield-wall role.
//!
//! # Rules references
//!
//! * CR 702.21 — Banding. Any creatures with banding, and up to one
//!   without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If
//!   any creatures with banding you control are blocking or being
//!   blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage,
//!   not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked
//!   by or is blocking.
//!
//! Banding is a base characteristic on this card; the runtime combat
//! pipeline handles the mechanic once `KeywordAbility::Banding` is
//! present in `keywords`.

//! Tyrant of Valakut — `{5}{R}{R}` 5/4 Dragon with Flying.
//!
//! Oracle:
//! * Surge {3}{R}{R}.
//! * Flying.
//! * When this creature enters, if its surge cost was paid, it deals 3
//!   damage to any target.
//!
//! Flying is a base characteristic. Surge is an alternative-cost keyword not
//! in the supported surface (GAP). The ETB damage is gated on "if its surge
//! cost was paid" — there is no cost-paid accessor, so firing the 3 damage
//! unconditionally would be wrong; the whole ETB ability is GAP'd.

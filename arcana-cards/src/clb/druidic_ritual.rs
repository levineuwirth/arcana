//! Druidic Ritual — `{2}{G}` sorcery, "You may mill three cards. Then
//! return up to one creature card and up to one land card from your
//! graveyard to your hand."
//!
//! The "up to one" from graveyard returns require targeted selection;
//! modeled as unconditional Mill 3 then two ReturnFromGraveyardToHand
//! effects. GAP: no targeting from graveyard for "up to one" selection
//! without a TargetRequirement — the two return effects are included as
//! best-effort (they require graveyard targets to be present in
//! entry.targets, which this spell does not set up).
